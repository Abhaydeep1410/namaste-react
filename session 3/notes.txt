we will use npm as a package manager

"parcel": "^2.12.0" means it will auto upgrade the version 
"2.12" means specific version only
~means approximate version    (^ careet  ~tilde)

package-lock means: to know exact version of library we are using becz "^2.12" will auto upgrade the version
therefore it locks the version and keep it safe , with package lock we can recreate the node modules in our project

// -D means we want parcel on our developer machine , means dev dependency
npm init  --to add package.json in our project  npm init -y skip lot of options
npm install to add that dependencies
npm install -D parcel-bundler
npm install react to install react in our node modules
npm install react-dom
npm parcel index.html  to run the server

npm parcel build index.html   -- to make production build

hot moduel replacement- parcel do to reflect the changes in code at realtime
file watcher algorithm(written in C++) -parcel use this to do hmr
bundling , minify and cleaning our code done by parcel , dev and production build, super fast build algorithm , 
image optimization, caching while development , compression , compatable with older version of browser,https on  dev
also manages port number 

npx parcel index.html --https, uses consistent hashing algorithms to cache, parcel is zero config bundler

port number manage, we should put parcel.cache in gitignore because anything which can be autogenerated should be push on server
tree shaking( removing unwanted code )

** transitive dependencies , ie one dependency is dependent on another  and it on another
