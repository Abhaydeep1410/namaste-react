inside packagelock.json there are scripts , we can write our own command 
    and then run it using npm run   ex. in scripts  "start":"parcel index.html"  --use  npm run start or npm start

to remove console.log  download an external plugin npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev
    check its usage from docs and after npm install ..  to config the plugin we need to create a file .babelrc

when using React.createElement we have to define keys also otherwise browser will give error as React needs keys  for recoincilation

using React.createElement for complex html will complex our code so we use JSX  , its a html like syntax (not html)
as we like attribute in jsx in camelCase  ex tab-index in html but tabIndex in JSX , class in HTML but className in JSX

it is Babel who understand JSX 


React Component 
  1. Functional Component - New way  are like normal js functions
  2. Class based Component - Old way


JSX used React.createElement behind the scenes
