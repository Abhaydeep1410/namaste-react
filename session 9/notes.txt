points to remember :-->
        we can only use JS expression inside {} , cant use statement like if else , user ternary
        never write useState() hook inside for or if statemnt 
        useState() hook is used inside functional component to declare variable so dont declare above 
        never write a functional component inside functional component because it will be created each time parent render, else we can use it by importing <>

useEffect(()=>{    // if we dont pass dependency array inside useEffect will be called after each render
                    // if we pass a empty dependency array it will be called once

})


routes -  npm i react-router-dom

// we are making a SPA - SIngle Page Application 
means it should not make a network call when reloading or going from section about to home like
// two types of routing client side and server side (usual with anchor tag with netwrok call )  ,but we want in our 
application client side , because all components are already presnet like about Page
so we use {Link } from react-router-dom 


// try to make login page using formik
