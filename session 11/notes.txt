we can create our own hook -> readability , usuability, maintainability, testability
name start with use for a hook


parcel is bundling all our files together into a single js file , but for a big website we dont want that
as for single component which dont have relation with other component like bookTrain dont depend on bookHotel 
so we want parcel not to bundel them together , so to avoid this we use lazy loading also called chunking, dynamic loading , code splitting, on demand loading, dynamic import 
check instamart to check its ususage, in app.js we dont directly import it

//point: never load component dynamically inside another component
